# 📄 ATS Eligibility Checker (NLP-Based)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a simple **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** that
checks whether a candidate is eligible for a job role based on **skill matching**.

The system compares **candidate-entered skills** with **job-required skills**
and provides a **clear and transparent eligibility decision**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Job-required skills are predefined
2. The candidate enters their skills (free-text input)
3. Skills are extracted and normalized
4. The system compares both skill sets
5. Output clearly shows:
   - Matched skills
   - Missing skills
   - Eligibility status

## 📥 Sample Input
Example candidate input used for testing is available here:  
[`data/sample_input.txt`](data/sample_input.txt)

This file represents the skills entered by a user during eligibility checking.

---

## 📊 Sample Output
Example system output generated by the ATS is available here:  
[`results/output_example.txt`](results/output_example.txt)

The output includes:
- Job-required skills
- Candidate skills
- Matched skills
- Missing skills
- Final eligibility decision

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- NLP (Text Matching & Skill Extraction)  
- Google Colab  
- Gradio (for interactive UI)

## 📌 Project Scope
- Focuses on skill-based eligibility logic
- Designed for learning and demonstration purposes
- Does not perform resume parsing or automated hiring decisions

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates how ATS systems perform **skill-based eligibility
analysis** in a simple, explainable, and structured manner.
